This respository contains the raw material for the Mamba Python course. The following folder system is used to sort the material:

- 'raw' is the folder for all the unsorted material (either mad by yourself or obtained from others with an appropiate license);
- 'Excercise_notebooks' contains all the sorted material in which:
    - 'basic' is used for the most basic material that everyone learning Python should know;
    - 'on-topic' is used for the material on certain topics, that you should only use if you're interested in the topics.
- 'Practical_examples' contains examples of using Python in practice

Once the material in 'Exercise_notebooks' is approved it will be moved to the MAMBA-python 'Course_material' repository.
